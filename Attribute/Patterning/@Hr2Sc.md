Spinal cord or Rhombomeres r2 patterning. Likely floor plate

Justification:

I am not very sure of this annotation

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870996] Vgll3 is detected by ISH in r2 during neural tube closure.


[10.1371/journal.pone.0124408] Nkx2.2 and Nkx2.9 Are the Key Regulators to Determine Cell Fate of Branchial and Visceral Motor Neurons in Caudal Hindbrain

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990212/] The transcription factors Nkx2.2 and Nkx2.9 have been proposed to execute partially overlapping functions in neuronal patterning of the ventral spinal cord in response to graded sonic hedgehog signaling. The present report shows that in mice lacking both Nkx2 proteins, the presumptive progenitor cells in the p3 domain of the neural tube convert to motor neurons (MN) and never acquire the fate of V3 interneurons.

Also I noticed that this cluster might be a atually two. 
One Dcn+ Vgll3- and the other Vgll3+ Dcn-
