Subcommissural organ hypendymal cell

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1111/bpa.12282] Comparison of gene expression profiles obtained in four PTPRs with that of 263 ependymomas yielded a total of 166 genes significantly overexpressed in PTPR (Supporting Information Table S3). Of note, these involved genes known to be highly expressed in the rodent subcommissural organ such as CALCA (coding for calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha; http://mouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/), FERD3L (Fer3-like bHLH transcription factor; Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, http://mouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/77439); and SPDEF (SAM-pointed domain containing Ets transcription factor; Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, http://mouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/29762)
