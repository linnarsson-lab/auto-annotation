Peripheral Sensory neurons

Justification:

[doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0901-11.2011] Many genes with known or potential roles in sensory neuronal function failed to be expressed in DKO ganglia. One example is peripherin (prph), an intermediate neurofilament protein that is expressed in both motor and sensory neurons. Peripherin expression decreased slightly in Brn3a KO and Islet1 CKO ganglia, but was nearly absent in the DKO DRG (Figure 4). In situ hybridization was used to examine the detailed expression patterns of the decreased transcripts Pirt, Gpr64, Cntn2/Tag1, Fgf13, Ppp1r1c, all of which were strongly expressed in the control DRG and showed changes in the mutant embryos that confirmed the array results (Figure 4)

In the Usoskin paper this cluster was called peptidergic nociceptors
