Cranial Motorneurons

Justification:

according to this paper:
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820498/]
the candidate cluster express markers of developing motorneurons. Furthermore, Lhx3 expression, which marks SPINAL CORD motorneurons is absent and PHOX2a, which marks CRANIAL motorneurons is expressed.
Other markers are Shox2, Isl2, Gal, Ntrk1

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.020] Here, we show that C1ql1, a member of the C1q family of proteins, is provided by climbing fibers (CFs) and serves as a crucial anterograde signal to determine and maintain the single-winner CF in the mouse cerebellum throughout development and adulthood.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.01.049] Expression of the Slc10a4 protein was detected in motor regions of the spinal cord and rhombencephalon, as well as in mesopontine cholinergic neurons, the medial habenula, cholinergic areas of the forebrain, and the gut myenteric plexus. Co-localization studies with the cholinergic marker proteins choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1) demonstrated expression of Slc10a4 in cholinergic neurons. ... Slc10a4 is regarded as a new marker protein for cholinergic neurons in the rat CNS
