Glutamatergic neurons of the cerebellum rhombic lip / flocculus, nodulus, uvula 

Justification: 
    1. Doc2g, Nnat both highly enriched in the nodulus and uvula, where UBCs are also prevalent [2]
    2. Expression of Calb2, which is typical of UBCs (and granule neurons), see ref Mugnaini et al below [1]
    3. Expression of Eomes, which is maintained in adult UBCs, but not adult granule cells [1,2]
