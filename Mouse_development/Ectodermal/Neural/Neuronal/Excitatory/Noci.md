Nociceptors (trigeminal or DRG)

Justification

[https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.2710] NGF signaling induces Hoxd1 expression in mammalian, but not avian, embryonic nociceptors. ... Hoxd1 instructs development of mammalspecific features of nociceptor axonal connections in the skin.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-4377-1679-5.00014-4] Nociceptors are a specific set of primary afferent nerve fibers that conduct noxious signals from peripheral somatic and visceral tissue to the spinal cord. They are pseudo-unipolar in architecture with distal and proximal projections arising from their cell bodies located in dorsal root and other sensory (e.g., trigeminal) ganglia

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.036] Runx1, a Runt domain transcription factor, is ex- pressed in most nociceptors during embryonic devel- opment but in adult mice, becomes restricted to noci- ceptors marked by expression of the neurotrophin receptor Ret. ... All
embryonic nociceptors initially express TrkA, a receptor for the nerve growth factor or NGF

They also express:
