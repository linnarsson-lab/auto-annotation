(Early) Visceromotor Migrating (Cranial) Motorneurons

[https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.02694] T-Box transcription factor Tbx20 regulates a genetic program for cranial motor neuron cell body migration.

Tbx20 is expressed by migrating branchiomotor/visceromotor (BM/VM) neurons within the hindbrain during neuronal circuit formation. We examined Tbx20 function in BM/VM cells using conditional Tbx20-null mutant mice to delete the gene in neurons. Hindbrain rhombomere patterning and the initial generation of post-mitotic BM/VM neurons were normal in Tbx20 mutants. However, Tbx20 was required for the tangential (caudal) migration of facial neurons, the lateral migration of trigeminal cells and the trans-median movement of vestibuloacoustic neurons.

To define genes that regulate the pattern of muscle nerve projections in the mouse limb, we surveyed Hox-dependent transcription factors (Dasen et al., 2003, Dasen et al., 2005) for their expression in newly generated LMC neurons.

Two Nkx class HD proteins, Nkx6.1 and Nkx6.2, are expressed by distinct subsets of postmitotic LMC neurons soon after cell cycle exit (Figures 1A–1D and 1I–1K). We analyzed the temporal profile of expression of Nkx6 proteins by developing motor neurons, focusing on rostral lumbar levels of the spinal cord. Nkx6.1 is expressed by all motor neuron progenitors (Figure 1A) (Vallstedt et al., 2001), but is rapidly extinguished at cell cycle exit,
