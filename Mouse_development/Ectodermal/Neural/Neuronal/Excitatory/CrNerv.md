Cranial Nerve Ganglia cells

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.24.16.7102-7112.2004] Sall3 transcripts are also found in developing cranial ganglia from E14.5 until birth (Fig. 2A, B, and E). In particular, the glossopharyngeal (IX), trigeminal (V), and vestibulocochlear (VIII) ganglia express robust levels of Sall3 at E16.5 (Fig.2E). The related family member Sall1 is expressed in overlapping regions in the developing brain and palate at early developmental stages (45). At E16.5, Sall1 is also highly expressed in the glossopharyngeal (IX), trigeminal (V), and vestibulocochlear (VIII) ganglia (Fig.2F)

[https://doi.org/10.1186/s13064-016-0057-y] POU6F2 and RUNX1 were expressed specifically in sub-divisions of the dorsolateral vestibulo-acoustic ganglion (Fig. 6D, E).
