Transient cell type that serves to guide projections towards entorhinal cortex [1].

Justification:

* Excitatory neurons expressing Reelin

"Reelin, the protein encoded by the RELN gene, is an extracellular matrix-associated glycoprotein expressed in the developing brain by CajalRetzius cells in the marginal zone of the cortex and hippocampus and by the cerebellar granule cells in the in the external granule cell layer. In the adult brain reelin is most abundant in GABAergic neurons"

Anti-EMX2 immunoreactivity is also detectable in CajalRetzius cells as well as in apical dendrites of marginal neurons of the cortical plate.
