Rhombomeres r3/r5 (odd numbered) patterning

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80728-X] Here, we show that during neurogenesis, Hox paralog group 2 genes control both anteroposterior (A-P) and dorsoventral (D-V) patterning. Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 differentially regulate, in a rhombomere-specific manner, the expression of several genes in broad D-V-restricted domains or narrower longitudinal columns of neuronal progenitors, immature neurons, and differentiating neuronal subtypes. Moreover, Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 can functionally synergize in controlling the development of ventral neuronal subtypes in rhombomere 3 (r3). Thus, in addition to their roles in A-P patterning, Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 have distinct and restricted functions along the D-V axis during neurogenesis, providing insights into how neuronal fates are assigned at stereotypic positions within the hindbrain.

[10.1101/gad.189801] Segmentation involves a restriction of cell intermingling at rhombomere boundaries due to alternating cell-surface properties that cause r3/r5 cells to be immiscible with r2/r4/r6 cells (Fraser et al. 1990; Guthrie and Lumsden 1991; Guthrie et al. 1993). 
We demonstrate that Krox-20 expression is sufficient to confer odd-numbered rhombomere characteristics to r2, r4, and r6 cells, presumably in a cell-autonomous manner. Therefore, Krox-20, appears as the major determinant of odd-numbered identity within the hindbrain.

Msx3, Fgf3

[PMID: 7789270] Within the developing cranial neural tube, Fgf-3 exhibits dynamic spatial and temporal expression. During extension of the head process, RNA is detected in the midline of the developing neural plate. In neurulating embryos, transcripts are observed initially in rhombomeres 4 and 5 of the hindbrain and later, in rhombomere 6. During hindbrain development, expression is lost from these rhombomeres, but becomes restricted to rhombomere boundaries, providing an intracellular marker which distinguishes a population of cells within boundary regions. Fgf-3 expression is elevated in ventral and medial boundary regions and is greatly reduced in dorsal parts. Studies of regenerating rhombomere boundaries show that Fgf-3 expression is induced in reforming boundaries when even-numbered rhombomere tissue is grafted next to odd, but not when like is juxtaposed to like. Fgf-3 disappears from boundary regions just prior to the loss of the morphological boundaries suggesting a boundary-associated function.Other sites of expression have also been identified. At early stages of development Fgf-3 is expressed in the epiblast and mesendoderm of the primitive streak, in mesoderm lateral to the streak and in Hensen's node. In older embryos transcripts are detected in the endoderm of the pharyngeal pouches, the ectoderm of the second and third pharyngeal arches and the stomodeum. Expression was also detected in the segmental plate and in the posterior half of the three most-recently generated somites.]

[https://doi.org/10.1016/0925-4773(96)00505-9] The embryonic expression of Msx-3 was found to differ from that of Msx-1 and -2 in that it was confined to the dorsal neural tube. In embryos with 5-8 somites a segmental pattern of expression was observed in the hindbrain, with rhombomeres 3 and 5 lacking Msx-3 while other rhombomeres expressed Msx-3.
