Striatal Neuroblasts, precursors of medium spiny neurons (probably only 2,3)

Justification:

From proximity in expression matrix to NbMSN2 and observation that Gucy1a3 and Adora2a are epressed in MNS2,3

Adora2a is very very low marker so with some other makrer if possible, but right now seem important to narrow down on 2.3
