The visceral endoderm develops in the murine embryo from the hypoblast and is an extraembryonic tissue that envelops the epiblast before gastrulation. The extraembryonic visceral endoderm is the outer layer of the extraembryonic ectoderm and is not known to contribute directly to the formation of any adult organs.
