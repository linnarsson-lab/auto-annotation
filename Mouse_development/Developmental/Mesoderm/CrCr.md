First heart field-derived cells

Justification:


Cardiac Crescent cells are defined as +Hand2 +Tbx20 +Smarcd3 (among others) by [http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/in-vivo-development/heart/cardiac-crescent/cardiac-crescent-cells]

Wnt2 accelerates cardiac myocyte differentiation from ES-cell derived mesodermal cells [10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.11.010]

They are also +Pitx2. Pitx2 is involved heart repair [https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17959]

Hand1, Pmp22, Tac2 are the markers shared by other heart progenitors
