Mesodermal cells

Justification:

Mesodermal cells distinct from the ones of the Node and primitive streak. They are aproximatevelly in the same area but more laterally. Most likely the perspective paraxial mesoderm.

Lefty2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC316797/] Interesting... Left right asimemtry determination.
Lefty1 and Lefty2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC316429/pdf/x2.pdf]
The asimmetry of Lefty2 should appear at 8.2 and last for very short time (Material and methods of the paper above)
