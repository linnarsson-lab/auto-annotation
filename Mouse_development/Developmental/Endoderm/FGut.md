Cells of endodermic origin that form the Foregut

Justification:

Note: Ende is the old name of Apela

[10.1016/j.gep.2010.02.001] Ende mRNA was first detected at embryonic day (E) 7.0 in a small population of epiblast cells in the distal half of the embryo. At E7.5, Ende was expressed by newly formed definitive endoderm cells in the proximal half of the embryo, and was not expressed in extra-embryonic endoderm. This expression pattern then changed to the ventral aspect of the developing foregut pocket and the entire hindgut pocket at E8.0-8.5, before becoming restricted to the foregut overlying the heart and the posterior most hindgut. By E9.0 Ende expression was also observed in the posterior half of the ventral neural tube. 

[10.1186/1471-213X-7-92] The same paper shows that there is a region overlap with Pyy. Pyy also found in the medial gut in this paper
