Anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) cells are extra-embryonic cells required for specifying anterior neural patterns by inhibiting primitive streak formation in the mouse embryo. The proximal ones are Lefty1 negative and are derived from the DVE.


Justification:

The AVE cells are induced at the distal tip of the 5.5 dpc embryo and then migrate to the prospective anterior, where they impart anterior identity on the underlying epiblast. The extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) restricts AVE induction to the distal tip of the mouse embryo and is required to initiate the migration of these cells to the prospective anterior.

At E6.7, three markers were co-expressed, but Cer1+, Hex+ cells located at the proximal region were negative for Lefty1 (8/8 embryos), indicating that AVE cells co-express Lefty1, Cer1 and Hex, although those in the most proximal region lose Lefty1 expression earlier than expression of Cer1 and Hex.

It was possible to specifically label DVE cells most probably because the action of tamoxifen is transient and because the expression level of Lefty1 is higher than that in newly formed AVE.
