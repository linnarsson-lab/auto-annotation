Neuroblast Midbrain type 8 subtype a

Justification:

Looking in the allen brain there are 3 possible locations (probably in all tree):
Posterior colliculum
Retromammilary area
Superficial cerebellar Emisphere

So it is found in the midbrain dataset but it is very posterior

This is based on the colocalization of the following:
