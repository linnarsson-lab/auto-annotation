Neuroblast glutamatergic maybe dorsal horn sensory (found in hindbrain dev data)

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135060] Tlx3 Promotes Glutamatergic Neuronal Subtype Specification through Direct Interactions with the Chromatin Modifier CBP

[https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4126-07.2008] Tlx1 and Tlx3 coordinate specification of dorsal horn pain-modulatory peptidergic neurons

[https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.01250] Lmx1b controls the differentiation and migration of the superficial dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord.

[PMID:11498051] The paired homeodomain protein DRG11 is required for the projection of cutaneous sensory afferent fibers to the dorsal spinal cord.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.modgep.2006.09.003] The homeodomain transcription factor drg11 is expressed in primary sensory neurons and their putative CNS targets during embryonic development of the zebrafish.

[https://doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.22305] Prrxl1 is required for the generation of a subset of nociceptive glutamatergic superficial spinal dorsal horn neurons.

Note: Prrxl1 is also known as drg11/DRG11
