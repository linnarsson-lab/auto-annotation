Neuroblast glutmatergic of the c1 domain of the hindbrain (it corresponds to the rhombic lip)

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2009.10.023] Math1 is Essential for the Development of Hindbrain Neurons Critical for Perinatal Breathing

Mice lacking the proneural transcription factor Math1 (Atoh1) lack multiple neurons of the proprioceptive and arousal systems and die shortly after birth from an apparent inability to initiate respiration. We sought to determine whether Math1 was necessary for the development of hindbrain nuclei involved in respiratory rhythm generation, such as the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN), defects in which are associated with Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS).

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.08.028] Math1 is expressed in temporally discrete pools of cerebellar rhombic-lip neural progenitors.

We have utilized an in vivo-inducible genetic-fate-mapping strategy to permanently label cohorts of Math1-positive cells and their progeny that arise in the rhombic lip of the cerebellar primordium during embryogenesis.


[https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/921732] The c1 domain, expressing Atoh1, corresponds to the rhombic lip that produces all types of glutamatergic neurons in the cerebellum.

Note: Atoh1 is also known as Math1
