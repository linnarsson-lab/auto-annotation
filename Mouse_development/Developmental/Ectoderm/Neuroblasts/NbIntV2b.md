Most nonTRN GABA neurons develop from a progenitor type in the rostral part of the thalamus.
Third, we report that Sox14, a post mitotic transcription factor expressed in the rTh, is necessary and sufficient to confer some nonTRN GABA neuron subtype features.
We recently defined the rTh in the mouse by the sequential expression of Helt, Tal1 and Sox14 transcription factor genes.
