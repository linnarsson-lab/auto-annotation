Striatal Neuroblasts, precursors of medium spiny neurons (probably only 1,4,5)

Justification:

Striatal localization from the overlap of Ebf1 and Rarb
(Ebf1 alone supports the the dorsal thalamus the precomissural pretectal domain)

Note has two receptors for the retinoic acid (Rarb and Rxrg)

Tac1 suggests also that they are MSNs

Note as the wiki suggests the other MSN make have a different origini in fact I found a neighbouring types that was expression Adora2a that a marker of the two missing MSN2 and MSN3

Wiki:
search: Rarb, Rxrg, Tac1
results: MSN1, MSN4, MSN5
