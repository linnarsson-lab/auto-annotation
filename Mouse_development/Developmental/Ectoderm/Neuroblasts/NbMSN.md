---

Striatal Neuroblasts, precursors of medium spiny neurons (probably only 1,4,5)

Justification:

Striatal localization from the overlap of Ebf1 and Rarb
(Ebf1 alone supports the the dorsal thalamus the precomissural pretectal domain)

Note the two receptors for the retinoic acid (Rarb and Rxrg)

Rarb, Rxrg, Tac1 -> Adolescent MSN1, MSN4, MSN5
