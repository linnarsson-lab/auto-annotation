Radialglia and Radialglia-like cells

A broad definition compatible to both
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.004]
Pollen et al. 2015
and 
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.027]
La Manno et al. 2016.

It is accurate only when applied to neuro-ectoderm derived cells might generate false positives in the mesodermal lineage.

Justification:

Notice that this is mostly a negative definition

-Kdr -Rgs5 avoid vascular cells

-Utf1 to avoid epiblast/ectoderm stem cells (Utf1 alone should be enough, it is redundant with cldn4)

-Cldn4 to avoid all lthe kind of ectoderm (e.g ectoderm of the face). (Cldn7 is another alternative but more stringent)

-Mpz to avoid Schwann cells to be called

-Plp1 is important to avoid including neural crest cells

 Other genes to take in consideration: +Notch3
