Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1159/000072271] "ROR· is expressed most prominently in the three principal
sensory nuclei of dTh, the ventroposterior nucleus (VP), the dLG, and the ventral part of the medial geniculatenucleus (MGv)"

In situ:
Rora [http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/ivt?id=100041514,100042358,100053213,100033860,100054699,100054927,100039419,100040008,2538,77371865,79488937,79631966,900,2537]

[https://doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.21024] AtE16.5...In the thalamus, Prox1 expression was detected in the epithalamus and the dorsal thalamus (Fig. 3A–H). In the prethalamus, Prox1 mRNA was observed surrounding the zona incerta and the reticular nucleus (Fig. 3C,E), in the subgeniculate nucleus, and in a ventral region of the zona incerta (Fig. 3F,H).
