Ciclying progentors cells (putativelly the progentiors of HinEx2).

Justification:

Notice they are ciclying but expression of cycling genes is not very high. They are probably not cells of the ventricular zone.

Expression of simialr marke of HinEx2

But is difficoult to locate and I found no matching

AllenBrain:
Tlx3 (it is located in the hindbrain and int the cranial nervers gangla e.g. trigeminal)
