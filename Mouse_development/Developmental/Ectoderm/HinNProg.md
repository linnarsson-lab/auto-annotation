Ciclying progentors cells

Justification:

Putativelly the progentiors of HinEx2.

AllenBrain:
Tlx3 (it is located in the hindbrain and int the cranial nervers gangla e.g. trigeminal)

Grin2c (subventricular zone of the 6th-7th rhombomere)

Fgf8 (hystmus, at E11 is broad layer, later it shrink to a very thin spot at E13.5)

Notice they are ciclying but expression of cycling genes is not very high. They are probably not cells of the ventricular zone.
