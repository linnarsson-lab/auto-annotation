Cells of endodermic origin that form the nasal epithelium / olfactory pit

[10.1073/pnas.2336223100] We demonstrate that Raldh3 knockout in mouse suppresses RA synthesis and causes malformations restricted to ocular and nasal regions, which are similar to those observed in vitamin A-deficient fetuses and/or in retinoid receptor mutants. Raldh3 knockout notably causes choanal atresia (CA), which is responsible for respiratory distress and death of Raldh3-null mutants at birth

"The overlying ectoderm, including primarily but not exclusively the olfactory placode, showed elevated expression of 68 genes, when compared to all other E9.5 compartments, excepting otic vesicle. These cells signal to the underlying cranial mesenchyme, and subsequently invaginate to form the olfactory pit. The enriched gene transcripts encoded ALDH1a3, thought to play an important role in establishing retinoic acid gradients, as well as the growth factors BMP4, PDGFA and PDGFC. Enriched transcription factor genes included Isl1, Pax6, Pitx1, and Six3. In addition there were a number of claudins (3,4,6,7,9), keratins (8,14,18,19), and Epcam, all associated with the epithelial nature of these cells. For a complete list see (Table S8)."

 The Lrp6-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway directly activates Msx1 and Msx2 expression, and directly or indirectly represses Raldh3 expression during normal lip formation and fusion. In a figure it is stated that "Prevents over fusion of lip ()Nasal fin/cavity formation)"


NOTE: Another very good marker is Pitx1
