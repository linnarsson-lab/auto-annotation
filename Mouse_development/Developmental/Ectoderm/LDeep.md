A broad annotation for a Deep layer cortical neuron signature

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1694]"Foxp2, a transcription factor of the winged-helix/forkhead family, 
is expressed in deep-layer neurons, becoming restricted to a 
subpopulation of layer 6 neurons. Tle4, also known as Grg4, 
which belongs to the groucho-related gene family, is expressed in 
deep layers"
