Activated/Reactive Astrocyte 

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003189] Probes which showed methylation changes at least in E14.5 NPCs or astrocytes compared to E11.5 NPCs are presented in Fig. 2A and Table S1 (Name of the probes and genes were indicated in Table S1). (about Cidea)

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143518] Immunohistochemical studies also demonstrated that human astrocytic Pla2g3 expression was significantly increased in human AD brains compared with control brains. Moreover, transfection of HEK293 cells with human Pla2g3 decreased endogenous IDE expression in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show a key role of Pla2g3 on the reduction of IDE, and suggest that cerebrum specific increase of Pla2g3 is involved in the initiation and/or progression of AD

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2013.12.071] Socs3 is also high, and also Stat3 is higher than in the other atrocytic cells
