Putative Tectum and Cerebellar Progenitors

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.055] Canopy1, a novel regulator of FGF signaling around the midbrain-hindbrain boundary in zebrafish.

Knockdown of cnpy1 resulted in MHB defects and impaired FGF signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. Cnpy1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with FGFR1. This study highlights a positive-feedback loop between the FGFR pathway and Cnpy1 that may ensure the strength of FGF signaling in the MHB, leading to correct development of the tectum and cerebellum.
