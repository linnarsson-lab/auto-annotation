[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023483] Tfap2e: In contrast, the more recently characterized Ap-2 transcription factors, Ap-2δ and Ap-2ε, show a more restricted expression pattern and are almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous system. Ap-2ε was mainly found in the developing olfactory bulb, the vomeronasal epithelium, and hypertrophic chondrocytes
