Interneurons from MGE
Expresses high levels of Lhx6 and Ackr3.

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3055-06.2007] "Here, we show that Lhx6, a gene induced in the medial ganglionic eminence and maintained in parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive interneurons, is required for the specification of these neuronal subtypes in the neocortex and the hippocampus. We also show that Lhx6 activity is required for the normal tangential and radial migration of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex."

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2010.12.005] "Here we demonstrated that CXCR7 (Ackr3) regulated interneuron migration autonomously, as well as nonautonomously through its expression in immature projection neurons. Migrating cortical interneurons coexpressed Cxcr4 and Cxcr7, and Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4–/– mutants had similar defects in interneuron positioning"
