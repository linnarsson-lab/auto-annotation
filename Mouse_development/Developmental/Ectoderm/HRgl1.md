Radialglia of the ventricular zone of the Hindbrain

Justification:

See @EDrCau

Notice Pax3 is more rostral (shared with the dorsal midbrain) while Msx3 is more caudale and shared by the spinal cord

Fgf15 domain maybe is the more lateral part

Alose there are some left-over Ptf1a+ cells in this cluster
