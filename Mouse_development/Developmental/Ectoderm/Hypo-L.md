Could be arcuate nucleus and lateral hypothalamus

Justification:

"In the anterior hypothalamus, Hmx2 and Hmx3 were principally expressed in the preoptic nucleus. 
Lower but significant levels of Hmx2 and Hmx3 expression were detected in the entire posterior 
hypothalamus with higher expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) and the lateral hypothalamic area"

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2004.06.016]
Besides the ARN, Galanin mRNA is also detectable in the periventricular nucleus 
(PVN; arrowhead in Figure 4Bc) and the lateral hypothalamic area of the hypothalamus, 
as well as many other regions in the brain such as the hippocampus (data not shown).
