Cranial Neural Crest cells or their progeny

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2012.0155] Whole-genome expression profiling of O9-1 cells revealed that this line stably expresses stem cell markers (CD44, Sca-1, and Bmi1) and neural crest markers (AP-2alpha, Twist1, Sox9, Myc, Ets1, Dlx1, Dlx2, Crabp1, Epha2, and Itgb1).

[https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.112078] Phactr1 is highly expressed in cells and tissues of neuronal origin (Allen et al., 2004), and its expression is associated with poor prognosis in melanoma, a neural crest-derived tumour

[https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.01033] In addition, the initial stages of cranial neural crest migration appear undisturbed, while at a later phase the craniofacial primordia in pharyngeal arches two to seven fail to express their typical set of genes (sox9a, wnt5a, dlx2, hoxa2/b2). In mobm610 mutant embryos, the cell number of neuronal and glial derivatives of neural crest is greatly reduced, suggesting that tfap2a is required for their normal development. 

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.051] Dlx2, a member of the homeodomain family of transcription factors, plays crucial roles in the development of the CNCCs derived craniofacial skeleton

Other relevant expressed genes:
Phactr1, Tfap2a, Tfap2b, Ccl6, Dlx1, Plcg2, Tnfaip6, Twist1
