Delaminating Neural Crest cells

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a008326] However, after reaching the branchial arches, FoxD3 and Sox10 expression diminishes, and, instead, neural crest cells express ectomesenchymal markers such as Dlx2 and Dlx5 (Depew et al. 1999, 2005; Blentic et al. 2008), which are conserved in both mouse and chick. Recent work in avians has also shown that the expression of Dlx2 and Dlx5 may be responsible for initiating the formation or condensation of mesenchyme into cartilage and bone, a process common to all vertebrates (Gordon et al. 2010). Moreover, Dlx5 acts as a mediator downstream from Bmp2 signaling in the promotion of Runx2 expression (Lee et al. 2003, 2005).

[https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.01033] In addition, the initial stages of cranial neural crest migration appear undisturbed, while at a later phase the craniofacial primordia in pharyngeal arches two to seven fail to express their typical set of genes (sox9a, wnt5a, dlx2, hoxa2/b2). In mobm610 mutant embryos, the cell number of neuronal and glial derivatives of neural crest is greatly reduced, suggesting that tfap2a is required for their normal development. 

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.051] Dlx2, a member of the homeodomain family of transcription factors, plays crucial roles in the development of the CNCCs derived craniofacial skeleton
