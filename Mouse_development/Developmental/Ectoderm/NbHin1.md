Neuroblast Hindbrain type 1 (gabaergic)

Justification:

It is a bit weird that the genes do not seem to colocalize

Wnt7b suggests ventricular zone.
Lypd1 suggests mantle zone of rhombomere 2
Trpc4 in the cerebbelar hemisphere
Gpc3 seemed to be a good marker but on allen brain atlas marked everything but the nervous system

Other markers: 
Cntnap4
Gm26793
Trpc4
Sla
Lrrc3b
Gm30382
