Similar to NblInh1, but expresses high levels of Adarb2 and Htr3a. Could be a interneuron derived mainly from the CGE.

Justification:

Htr3a is a Serotonin-Gated Ion Channel Receptor. "Here we show that the ionotropic serotonin receptor 3A (5-HT3AR) is specifically expressed in CGE-derived migrating interneurons and upregulated while they invade the developing cortex."
