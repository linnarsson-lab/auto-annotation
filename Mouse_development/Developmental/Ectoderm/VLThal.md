Ventrolateral thalamus (likely to be the subthalamic nucleus)

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.10.035] "In mouse, Pitx2 is expressed in postmitotic neurons of the midgestation CNS, including GABAergic neurons of future thalamus and midbrain, and neurons of the subthalamic nucleus."
""The subthalamic nucleus is the only glutamatergic basal ganglia nucleus"
"PITX2 is required for normal development of neurons in the mouse subthalamic nucleus and midbrain"
