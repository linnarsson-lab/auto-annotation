Pluripotent stem cells of the Epiblast and Primitive Ectoderm

Justification:

NOTE: Pou5f1 is better known as Oct4

[https://doi.org/10.1093/emboj/17.7.2019] We have obtained a novel transcriptional cofactor, termed undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1), from F9 embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells. This protein is expressed in EC and embryonic stem cells, as well as in germ line tissues, but could not be detected in any of the other adult mouse tissues tested. Furthermore, when EC cells are induced to differentiate, UTF1 expression is rapidly extinguished. In normal mouse embryos, UTF1 mRNA is present in the inner cell mass, the primitive ectoderm and the extra-embryonic tissues.

[...] Expression of markers of pluripotency (Rex1, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2), epiblast (Tcf15, Otx2 and Fgf5), neuroectoderm (Sox1 and Zfp521) and mesendoderm (T/Bra and Eomes) was measured. [...] Fgf5 and Otx2. [...]  expression of the epiblast affiliated genes Fgf5 and Otx2

[https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-213X-9-5] Fgf 5 is a marker of primitive ectoderm

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159246] Fibroblast growth factor 5 (Fgf5) has been widely used as a marker for the epiblast in the postimplantation embryo and epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) in the mouse, making it valuable for study of differentiation of various tissues and epiblast cells in vivo and in vitro

[http://jcs.biologists.org/content/115/2/329.long] Detailed mapping of these genes with Oct4, Rex1 and Fgf5 on pregastrulation embryos provided the first molecular evidence for the existence of successive, temporally distinct pluripotent cell populations in the embryo between the ICM and primitive ectoderm

[10.1242/bio.20135934] We observed the expected rapid decrease in Rex1, Nanog and Oct4 expression as cells exit pluripotency, as well as transient expression of the epiblast affiliated genes Fgf5 and Otx2. There is also an expected, steady increase in the expression of genes associated with neural fates (Sox1 and Zfp521) and an early decrease in the expression of Sox2 as cells exit pluripotency, followed by an increase as cells adopt neural fates.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.01.014] The RNA-binding protein L1TD1 is one of the most specific and abundant proteins in pluripotent stem cells and is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in human cells.
