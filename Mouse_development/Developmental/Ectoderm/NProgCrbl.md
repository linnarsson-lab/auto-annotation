Neural Progenitors Cerebellar Vermis (pc2) in the Hindbrain

Justification:

[http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/100098141] Ptf1a localization

The gene is involved in cerebellar development:
[https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1475] Mutations in PTF1A cause pancreatic and cerebellar agenesis.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230566310_GABAergic_Neuron_Specification_in_the_Spinal_Cord_the_Cerebellum_and_the_Cochlear_Nucleus/figures] 

The pc2 is the Ptf1a-expressing neuroepithelial domain that generates all types of GABAergic cerebellar neurons

[https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0479-11.2011] Moreover, a recent genetic fate mapping study using Ascl1CreER-knock-in mice showed that minor cerebellar GABAergic neurons, such as Lugaro and candelabrum cells, are also derived from the cerebellar VZ
