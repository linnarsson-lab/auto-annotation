Migratory pyramidal

Justification:

Not sure yet if this is the right stage, but:

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcn.2008.04.002] The cortical subventricular zone-specific molecule Svet1 
is part of the nuclear RNA coded by the putative netrin receptor gene Unc5d and is expressed in multipolar migrating cells.


[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.04.025] "In the intermediate zone... migrating precursors move tangentially and initiate the extension of their axons by transiently adopting a characteristic multipolar morphology... Migratory pyramidal cells dynamically express FoxG1 during the multipolar phase... Transient FoxG1 downregulation facilitates the MP transition by inducing Unc5D.... FoxG1 reinitiation allows cells to progress from the MP into the cortical plate.


[https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2015.00274] "Expression and loss-of-function studies have indicated that the [upper layer] neurons of the neocortex include at least two subpopulations, Satb2+ and Unc5d+ neurons; whereas Satb2+ neurons migrate toward the CP immediately after their cell cycle exit, Unc5D-positive cells undergo a longer waiting period...within the SVZ."


Also the cells express Nrp1, which is expressed in migrating neurons:
