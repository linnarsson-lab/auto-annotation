Anterior Neural Plate aka Presumptive Forebrain (E8.5)

Justification:

[http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/in-vivo-development/neural-ectoderm/neural-plate/cranial-neural-plate-cells]
Neural plate cells are specialized neural ectoderm cells that are destined to undergo neurulation and become part of the neural tube.  Neurulation mechanisms and timing is somewhat different between regions that are destined to become the brain (the cranial region) versus the spinal cord. Thus, neural plate cells are categorized in the database as either cranial or spinal cells.

Approximately 24 hours after Hesx1 transcripts are first detected in the endoderm, they start to appear in adjacent ectoderm that gives rise to the most anterior component of the developing CNS

The Homeobox Gene Hesx1 Is Required in the Anterior Neural Ectoderm for Normal Forebrain Formation]

[https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-511] One of the most highly down-regulated genes in the Foxa2 null data set was Foxd4 (formerly fkh-2). Foxd4 expression is completely lost in the axial midline of Foxa2 null embryos at E8.5 and is also slightly reduced in the anterior neuroectoderm (ANE)
That loss of organizer derivatives leads to reduction of ANE markers Six3, Hesx1, Foxg1, and Fgf8
