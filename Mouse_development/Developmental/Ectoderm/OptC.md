These data suggest that TRMP1 mutations are a major cause of autosomal-recessive CSNB in individuals of European ancestry. We localized TRPM1 in human retina to the ON bipolar cell dendrites in the outer plexifom layer.

Vax2 expression in mouse embryos is restricted to the entire inferior neural retina, starting from E9 (A), when it is expressed in the ventral half of the optic cup, to E12.5 (B) and E16.5 (C)

[https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.045401] Two of the vertebrate complexins, Cplx3 and Cplx4, are specifically localized to retinal ribbon synapses. Our results show that Cplx3 and Cplx4 are essential regulators of transmitter release at retinal ribbon synapses
