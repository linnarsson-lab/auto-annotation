Entorhinal cortex cells

Justification:

[https:/doi.org/10.1002/cne.24278] In young adult mice: "Cbln4 expression was weak, but was clearly detectable by immunohistochemistry in distinct regions throughout the brain, with the highest levels in the retrosplenial cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the zonal layer of the superior colliculus."

Cbln4 [http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/ivt?id=100081745,100046531,100046447,100057149,100057266,100042352,100042103,72283804,69540435,100082215,100084731]
