Epithalamus

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-015-1052-5]
"Pou4f1 (Brn3a) was expressed in the entire epithalamus. Irx2, Nr4a2, and Neurod1 showed expression in a subset of MHb and LHb cells... Pou4f1, Nr4a2, and Neurod1 were also specific for the mouse epithalamus. Both thalamic and epithalamic derivatives of the alar part of prosomere 2 in mouse and human were clearly delineated by the expression of Tcf7l2"

Also expresses:
Irx2
Nr4a2
Neurod1 (in some cells)
Gpr151 (in some cells)
