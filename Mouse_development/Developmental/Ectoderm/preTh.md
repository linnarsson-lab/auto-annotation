Justification:

Fign Ramp3 Meis2 Esrrg AI593442 -> Adolescent DEINH1, DEINH2

[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-015-1052-5] This paper suggests that the RT and ZLI express Meis2, Zfp804a, Isl1. The RT expresses Six3, and the ZLI expresses Pax6.


[https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8104-9-14] "TRN neurons are defined by the expression of the parvalbumin gene [4], their fast spiking action and specific connectivity, which is strictly confined within the thalamus."

Also expresses:
