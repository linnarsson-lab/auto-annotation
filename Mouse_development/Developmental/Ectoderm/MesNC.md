Mesenchymal Facial Neural Crest cells (precursors of the GUM cells)

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.016] The mandibular arch, when compared to cranial mesenchyme, overlying ectoderm, neuroepithelium and otic vesicle, gave 232 genes with enriched transcripts. A series graph of these enriched genes shows that the expression patterns for the mandibular and maxillary arches were quite similar, with genes showing elevated expression in one generally also showing elevated expression in the other (Fig. 3). Five genes gave particularly robust elevated expression in these two compartments, Barx1, Emcn, Lhx8, Mab21l1 and Kcne3.

For example, an analysis of the mandibular arch elevated genes, compared to all other compartments excepting the maxillary arch, which shows a strongly overlapping gene expression pattern, identified the strongly expressed transcription factor genes Hand1, Hand2, Osr1, Twist2, Lhx6, Lhx8, Barx1, and Dlx1
