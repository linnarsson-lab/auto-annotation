Radialglia according to Pollen et al. 2015 and La Manno et al. 2016. Other genes to take in consideration: +Notch3

Justification:

Notice that this is mostly a negative definition

-Kdr -Rgs5 avoid vascular cells

-Utf1 to avoid epiblast/ectoderm stem cells (Utf1 alone should be enough, it is redundant with cldn4)

-Cldn4 to avoid all lthe kind of ectoderm (e.g ectoderm of the face). (Cldn7 is another alternative but more stringent)

-Mpz to avoid Schwann cells to be called
