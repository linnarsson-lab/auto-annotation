Early patterning of the neural tube caudal to the hindbrain 

Justification:

Cpn1 seem related to a thoracic-ventral patterning and its expression in shared by neural tube, endoderm and visceral yolk

[http://dx.doi.org.proxy.kib.ki.se/10.1016/S1567-133X(03)00091-7] Sfrp5 is also expressed in the dorsal portion of the neural tube just caudal to the hindbrain. In embryos that had completed turning, we noted an additional domain of Sfrp5 expression in the forebrain anterior to the optic placode ( Fig. 2G).

[DOI: 10.1186/1471-213X-7-92] In addition, Cpn1 and 1700011H14Rik showed strikingly similar expression patterns suggesting they may be co-regulated. [...] Table 2 Tissue restricted expression of the genes isolated by whole mount in situ hybridization.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.040] In E8.5 wild-type embryos, Cpn1 is expressed in the visceral yolk sac endoderm, as the definitive endoderm of the midgut and hindgut, as well as in the neural tube

There might be some overlap with @Hr3r5.
Also same markers characterize the patterning of the endoderm
