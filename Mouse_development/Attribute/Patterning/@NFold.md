Cells at the margin/dosal-part of the closing neural tube.  

Justification:

[10.1242/dev.02072] At E9.5, Msx1 and Msx2 are expressed in the dorsal neural tube (Fig. 5)

[10.1002/dvdy.22044] Wnt1 has been shown to be expressed in neural crest precursors at the dorsal midline region

Note: Those cells are Neural crest progenitors.
