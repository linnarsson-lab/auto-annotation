Patterning of early neural progenitors that will give rise to the Diencephalon

Justification:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27887593] We found that Barhl2 is expressed in the developing diencephalon from the time of anterior neural tube closure. ts expression initially overlaps that of Pax6 in a central region of the alar diencephalon but over the following days their domains of expression become complementary in most forebrain regions. The exceptions are the thalamus and pretectum, where countergradients of Pax6 and Barhl2 expression are established by embryonic day 12.5, before overall Pax6 levels in these regions decline greatly while Barhl2 levels remain relatively high. We found that Barhl2 expression becomes upregulated in specifically the thalamus and pretectum in Pax6-null mice.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009495/] Six6, a sine oculis homeobox protein, plays a crucial and conserved role in the development of the forebrain and eye.

Pax6 is in common with more anteriror forebrain.

The selection of -Robo3 is from inspection not literature
