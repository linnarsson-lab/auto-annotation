Early Dorsal caudal part of the Hindbrain and rostral Spinal Cord, 

Justification:

[PMID: 8887328] Msx3: a novel murine homologue of the Drosophila msh homeobox gene restricted to the dorsal embryonic central nervous system.

RNA in situ analysis of Msx3 gene expression during early development revealed that it is restricted to the dorsal portion of the neural tube with a rostral boundary in the rostral rhombencephalon. This sole expression domain for Msx3 overlaps with both Msx1 and Msx2 at early stages, but in older embryos, Msx3 expression becomes restricted to the ventricular zone of the dorsal neural tube, whereas Msx1 and Msx2 become localized to the non-neuronal roof plate region.

[doi: 10.1242/dev.099002] Msx1 and Msx2 act as essential activators of Atoh1 expression in the murine spinal cord

Dorsal spinal neurogenesis is orchestrated by the combined action of signals secreted from the roof plate organizer and a downstream transcriptional cascade. Within this cascade, Msx1 and Msx2, two homeodomain transcription factors (TFs), are induced earlier than bHLH neuralizing TFs

Note that the stainings seem to suggest that the level of expression of Pax6 could further discriminate more dorsal (Pax6 low) from more ventral (Pax6 high)

[DOI: 10.1242/dev.00994] Distinct activities of Msx1 and Msx3 in dorsal neural tube development.
This aspect of Bmp signaling is phenocopied by the overexpression of Msx3 but not Msx1. Taken together, these results suggest that these two different Msx family members can mediate distinct aspects of Bmp signaling during neural tube development.
