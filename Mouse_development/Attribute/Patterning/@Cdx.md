Posterior patterning by Cdx genes 

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mod.2010.09.004] The products of the Cdx genes, Cdx1, Cdx2 and Cdx4, play multiple roles in early vertebrate development, and have been proposed to serve to relay signaling information from Wnt, RA and FGF pathways to orchestrate events related to anterior-posterior vertebral patterning and axial. [...] Cdx4 is initially detected at E7.5 in the base of the allantois and posterior primitive streak and subsequently in the unsegmented paraxial mesoderm with a rostral limit posterior to the most recently formed somite ( Gamer and Wright, 1993). Cdx4 is also found in the neural ectoderm, with expression slightly more rostral than its domain in the paraxial mesoderm, and is extinguished by E10.5 ( Lohnes, 2003).
