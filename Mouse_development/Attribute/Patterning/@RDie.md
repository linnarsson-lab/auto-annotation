Prosomeres 2/3 of the diencephalon basal plate and mammilary area and Commissural area of the pretectum

Justification:

[https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/9.9.1443] This is a good reference paper for the pattern of Barhl1: "Barhl1 showed specific domains of expression in the diencephalon and in the rhombencephalon where it was found to be expressed in migrating cells giving rise to the cerebellar external granular layer and to specific populations of dorsal sensory interneurons of the spinal cord"

Other papers:
[doi: 10.1128/MCB.01454-07] About regulation of Barhl1 by Atoh1: "proper Barhl1 expression in inner ear hair cells and cerebellar and precerebellar neurons requires the presence of Atoh1"

[doi: 10.1002/jez.a.184] "Sstr2 was reported in the different diencephalic regions plus in mesencephalon and telencephalon while low values were obtained in the cerebellum" ... "At the same time high levels of neurons expressing sstr5-like, that greatly overlap those of sstr2-like in the diencephalic areas such as the anteroventral part of the preoptic nucleus (NPOav), the dorsal habenular nucleus (NHd) and the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VL), indicate that sstr2-like is very likely not the only sstr subtype acting in this fish brain"
