SKOR1 (SKI family transcriptional corepressor 1) has appealing links to RLS, as it is expressed selectively in a subset of dorsal horn interneurons in the developing spinal cord, which relay pain and touch. The SKOR1/Lbx1 pathway is essential to the generation of a GABAergic versus glutamatergic phenotype in these cells (Cheng et al., 2005), and this locus may contribute to the sensory component of the phenotype by affecting modulation of sensory and pain inputs.

These cells are gabaergic: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896627/]
Most hox genes identified map on the spinal cord (especially Hoxb7/8). Some maps from the 3rd rombomere down (Hoxb3)
