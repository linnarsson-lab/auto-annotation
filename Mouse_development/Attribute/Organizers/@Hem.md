[http://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-4773(02)00254-X] In the forebrain, Lmx1a was strongly expressed in the roof plate of the telencephalic vesicles, i.e. in the cortical hem and the choroid plexuses

Other markerks:

Lmx1a, Dmrt3, Bmp7
Galnt12, Gyltl1b
Wnt8b, Wnt3a, Rspo1, Rspo2, Rspo3, Bmp4

At E13.5 Rspo2 is the best marker
