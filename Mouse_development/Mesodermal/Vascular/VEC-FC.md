Vascular endothelial cell that are fenestrated and probably attract microglia

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2012.09.011] "Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP, PV-1) is an endothelial protein that specifically localizes to diaphragms of fenestrae in fenestrated capillaries, and to stomatal diaphragms of caveolae."" ... "In mouse, pig and human eyes, immunoreactivity for PLVAP was present in fenestrated capillaries of choroid and ciliary processes, but not in the continuous capillaries of retina and ciliary muscle"

[doi:10.1038/ni.3101] "In the lymphatic sinus, PLVAP forms a physical sieve that regulates the parenchymal entry of lymphocytes and soluble antigens.""

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004994] Additional functional analysis of two newly discovered genes, hapln1b and sh3gl3, demonstrates their importance in embryonic vascular development.  During early stages of zebrafish development, hapln1b is expressed in the hypochord, cranial vasculature, posterior cardinal vein, and caudal hematopoietic tail region
