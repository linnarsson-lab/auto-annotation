Claudins are a family of proteins that are the most important components of the tight junctions.

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2007.10.018] Structure and function of claudins. [...] Claudins are tetraspan transmembrane proteins of tight junctions. They determine the barrier properties of this type of cell-cell contact existing between the plasma membranes of two neighbouring cells, such as occurring in endothelia or epithelia. . [...] Sequence analysis of claudins has led to differentiation into two groups, designated as classic claudins (1-10, 14, 15, 17, 19) and non-classic claudins (11-13, 16, 18, 20-24), according to their degree of sequence similarity
