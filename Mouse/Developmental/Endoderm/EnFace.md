Cells (probably of endodermic origin) that shape internal part of the face

Justification:

[10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.06.034] Vgll2 is differentially expressed in the developing facial prominences 
vgll2a is required within the pharyngeal endoderm for NCC survival and pharyngeal cartilage development

I am not very sure of this definition
