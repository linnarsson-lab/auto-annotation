TODO: do we know for sure these cells are mesodermal?

Justification:

* Expresses canonical vascular smooth muscle marker Acta2 (also known as ASMA)

Tpm2 is very bad as a marker for development where many cell types it express it, substituted with Actg2
Added Ly6c1 to distinguish it from Endothelial cells.

Tagln works but marks VSM less clean than the other cell types than the others, so I removed it
