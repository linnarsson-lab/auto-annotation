Angioblasts originating from the mesoderm enter the head region and form the perineural vascular plexus. This vasculogenic process triggers the development of the CNS vasculature.

Justification:

They are also positive for a lot other markers shared by the more mature vascular cells.
therefore I use the more specific markers -Slc38a5 -Ly6a -Nostrin

Previously: +Plvap +Prl3b1 +Clec1b -Slc38a5 -Ly6a -Nostrin  but did not work
