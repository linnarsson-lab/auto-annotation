Similar to NblInh1, but expresses high Lhx6 and Ackr3.

Justification:

"Here, we show that Lhx6, a gene induced in the medial ganglionic eminence and maintained in parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive interneurons, is required for the specification of these neuronal subtypes in the neocortex and the hippocampus. We also show that Lhx6 activity is required for the normal tangential and radial migration of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex."

Found in Forebrain Dorsal E16-18 (At this stage, the cluster is partly Sst+ and can possibly be further split. Initially clusters with MigInt1 and NblInh1)
