Neuroblast of V2a interneurons (found in the hindbrain)

Justification:

Notice: Vsx2 is commonly known referred to as Chx10



Note the classical hinibitory genes markers are not expressed but this is clearly expressing markers of V2a interneurons

Here, we report that Nkx6.3 expression is specific to Chx10+ V2a interneurons but not to Gata3+ V2b interneurons of the hindbrain

(Dâ€“H1) Immunohistochemical detection of V0 interneurons (Evx1, [D and D1]), V1 interneurons (En1, [E and E1]); V2a interneurons (Chx10, [F and F1]), V2b interneurons (GATA2/3, [G and G1]), and MNs (Hb9, [H and H1]) in the lumbar spinal cord of Chx10-DTA E13.5 embryos and wild-type littermates.

(I and I1) In situ hybridization to detect Sim1 mRNA, a marker of V3 interneurons, in the lumbar spinal cord of Chx10-DTA E11.5 embryos and wild-type littermates. The number of Chx10+ interneurons is dramatically reduced in Chx10-DTA embryos (F1) compared with that of wild-type littermates (F). However, the number and location of V0 interneurons (Evx1, [D1]), V1 interneurons (En1, [E1]); V2b interneurons (GATA2/3, [G1]) and MNs (Hb9, [H1]) is not altered in Chx10-DTA mice. Expression of Sim1 is also similar in Chx10-DTA embryos (I1) and wild-type embryos (I).
