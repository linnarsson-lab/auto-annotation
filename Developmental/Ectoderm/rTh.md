a population in the rostral thalamus/caudal pretectum that will give rise to Dlx2-negative GABAergic neurons

Justification:

"We describe a neuronal population in the r-Th and caudal pretectum defined by the 
hierarchical expression of three transcription factors. This population arises in 
the Ascl1-positive progenitor domain, progressing from an early proliferating cell 
type expressing Helt to its most differentiated progeny expressing Sox14. Upon 
Helt downregulation and before Sox14 induction, this population also activates expression Tal1"

"We therefore conclude that all Dlx2-negative GABAergic neurons in the diencephalon arise 
from the Helt-, Tal1-, and Sox14-positive population and that Dlx2 expression 
or lack of it defines two alternative GABAergic subtypes."

Also expresses:
Sox14

Pnoc

Note: KILLED because it was marking 10 types of midbrain inhibitory neurons/neuroblasts 
-> added +Sox14 and -Dlx2 to the definition
