Justification:

"We describe a neuronal population in the r-Th and caudal pretectum defined by the hierarchical expression of three transcription factors. This population arises in the Ascl1-positive progenitor domain, progressing from an early proliferating cell type expressing Helt to its most differentiated progeny expressing Sox14. Upon Helt downregulation and before Sox14 induction, this population also activates expression Tal1"
