Choroid Plexus cells

Justification:

Ttr - [http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/in-vivo-development/brain/choroid-plexus/mature-choroid-plexus-cells]

Kcne2 - It is annotated as choriod cells in LifeMap/GeneCards [http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/gene-expression-signals/high-throughput/large-scale-dataset-eurexpress/forebrain/telencephalon/choroid-invagination/choroid-plexus]

I removed Aqp1 because it is not expressed in the developing ones instead I put some suggested by autoannotation
