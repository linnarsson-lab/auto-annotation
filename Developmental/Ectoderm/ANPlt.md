Anterior Neural Plate

Justification:

[http://discovery.lifemapsc.com/in-vivo-development/neural-ectoderm/neural-plate/cranial-neural-plate-cells]
Neural plate cells are specialized neural ectoderm cells that are destined to undergo neurulation and become part of the neural tube.  Neurulation mechanisms and timing is somewhat different between regions that are destined to become the brain (the cranial region) versus the spinal cord. Thus, neural plate cells are categorized in the database as either cranial or spinal cells.

Approximately 24 hours after Hesx1 transcripts are first detected in the endoderm, they start to appear in adjacent ectoderm that gives rise to the most anterior component of the developing CNS
