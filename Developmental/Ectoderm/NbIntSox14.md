a population in the rostral thalamus/caudal pretectum that will give rise to Dlx2-negative GABAergic neurons

Justification:

1) "We describe a neuronal population in the r-Th and caudal pretectum defined by the hierarchical expression of three transcription factors. This population arises in the Ascl1-positive progenitor domain, progressing from an early proliferating cell  type expressing Helt to its most differentiated progeny expressing Sox14. Upon Helt downregulation and before Sox14 induction, this population also activates expression Tal1"

"We therefore conclude that all Dlx2-negative GABAergic neurons in the diencephalon arise from the Helt-, Tal1-, and Sox14-positive population and that Dlx2 expression 
or lack of it defines two alternative GABAergic subtypes."

2) About GABAergic thalamic neurons: "The TRN neurons derive from GABAergic progenitors in the embryonic prethalamic (pTh) compartment [5]. Whilst it was long thought that all thalamic inhibitory neurons originate in the pTh, it is now clear that the thalamus proper contains a resident population of neuronal progenitors fated to become inhibitory. Most nonTRN GABA neurons develop from a progenitor type in the rostral part of the thalamus (rTh)... Expression of Dlx2 defines neuronal progenitors in the pTh and is not expressed in the rTh.
