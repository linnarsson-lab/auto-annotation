Pre-placodal Ectoderm (It is an anterior lateral crescent-shaped region that forms at the boundary of the neural plate and neural crest )

Justification:

[doi: 10.1242/dev.071456] RARα2 signaling induces key pre-placodal genes and establishes the posterolateral borders of the PPE. RAR signaling upregulates two important genes, Tbx1 and Ripply3, during early PPE development. In the absence of RIPPLY3, TBX1 is required for the expression of Fgf8 and hence, PPE formation. In the presence of RIPPLY3, TBX1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, and functions to restrict the positional expression of Fgf8, a key regulator of PPE gene expression.


Very nice ISH shows the Fig1 A and A'
[doi: 10.1242/dev.054056] In the mouse embryo, pharyngeal arches develop in a rostral-to-caudal manner. At E8.5, when the first arch formation is observed, Ripply3 signals were observed in the pharyngeal ectoderm. [...] Ripply3, a Tbx1 repressor, is required for development of the pharyngeal apparatus and its derivatives in mice. [...] Whole-mount in situ hybridization for mouse Ripply3 at E8.5 (A,A′), E8.75 (B), E9.0 (C), E9.5 (D) and E10.0 (E). A transverse section of an E8.5 embryo hybridized with the Ripply3 probe indicates that Ripply3 is expressed in the ectoderm at this stage (A′)
