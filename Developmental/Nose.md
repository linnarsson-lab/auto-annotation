Cells of endodermic origin that form the nasal epithelium

Justification:

[http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/100073541] Allen brain staining

[10.1073/pnas.2336223100] We demonstrate that Raldh3 knockout in mouse suppresses RA synthesis and causes malformations restricted to ocular and nasal regions, which are similar to those observed in vitamin A-deficient fetuses and/or in retinoid receptor mutants. Raldh3 knockout notably causes choanal atresia (CA), which is responsible for respiratory distress and death of Raldh3-null mutants at birth

Maybe also endoderm of the ocular reagion
