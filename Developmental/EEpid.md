Epidermal ectoderm covering the face.

Justification:

[doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.016]
"The overlying ectoderm, including primarily but not exclusively the olfactory placode, showed elevated expression of 68 genes, when compared to all other E9.5 compartments, excepting otic vesicle. These cells signal to the underlying cranial mesenchyme, and subsequently invaginate to form the olfactory pit. The enriched gene transcripts encoded ALDH1a3, thought to play an important role in establishing retinoic acid gradients, as well as the growth factors BMP4, PDGFA and PDGFC. Enriched transcription factor genes included Isl1, Pax6, Pitx1, and Six3. In addition there were a number of claudins (3,4,6,7,9), keratins (8,14,18,19), and Epcam, all associated with the epithelial nature of these cells. For a complete list see (Table S8)."
