Trophoblast cells that compose the Corion, they are also defined as Extraembryonic ectoderm.

Justification:

[10.1155/2015/218518] Exprection of Elf5+ is key event for phate determination.
[10.1093/humrep/det129] Tex19.1 gene plays an essential role in placenta-supported development.
[10.1155/2015/218518] A Resource for the Transcriptional Signature of Bona Fide Trophoblast Stem Cells, mentions Nr0b1

Other markers in the dataset include:
Higly enriched: Tex19.1, Gjb3, Tfap2c, Tead4
Exclusive: Elf5, Nr0b1, Zfp42, Prss50 

Some of the markers described previously are not very specific.
