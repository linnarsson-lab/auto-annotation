Early Mesoderm involved in gastrulation. It includes Primitive streak, Nascent/Emergent mesoderm, Node, Prospective axial mesendoderm, Notochordal plate.

Justification:

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800043-4.00003-8]
The markers are Noto, Chrd, T, Gm16702, Nog, Fst, Foxa2
Their expression is dynamic and they might mark divverent part of the mesodermic lineages at different Teyler stages.
I expect at least two cell types (anterior/node, posterior/streak). Requires more attention ot get it right.

[10.1242/dev.050567]
Noto (and probably Chrd) are in more anterior part corresponding to the anterior streak/node.
