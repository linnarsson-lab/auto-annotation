name: Interneuron, hippocampus
abbreviation: HC-Cacna2d1-Lhx6
definition: +Gad1 +Npy +Id2 +Lamp5 +Cryab -Sst
categories: Ectodermal Neuronal Neuroectodermal
---

Inhibitory interneurons across HC (Allen Brain: CA, DG hilus and SGZ)

Kenneth Harris: Cacna2d1.Lhx6 "putative MGE-derived neurogliaform"
most closely resembles Cacna2d1.Lhx6, although couldn't check for Cacn2d1. Lhx6 expression makes them MGE derived.

Other markers:
Broad: +Gad1 +Cck -Pvalb +Npy +Pnoc +Lhx6
Specific: +Hapln1

Potential subcluster:
KH also identified -Lhx6 cluster with similar specific markers (Lamp5 etc.), called Cacna2d1.Ndnf "CGE-derived neurogliaform"
