synonyms:
- Neuronal stem cell
- Radial astrocyte
- Type 1 progenitor
- Type B cell
---

Neuronal stem cells that persist into adulthood and give rise to granule cells ([DG-GC]) throughout life [1].

Justification:

* Similar to, but distinct from, astrocytes in the dentate gyrus
* Expressing Hes5 and (very weakly) Nes
* Not actively cycling
