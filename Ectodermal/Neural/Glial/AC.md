Justification:

* Expresses canonical astrocyte markers Gja1, Aldoc and Aqp4

Aqp4 coud be pretty low in some astrocytic cell types in development, not sure about Htra1.
Tnc and Aldh1a1 seem better. I added Tnc to the definition.

More subtipes of astrocytes should be covered. This includes defining the subgroups: Agt+ / Agt- , Gfap+/Gfap-
