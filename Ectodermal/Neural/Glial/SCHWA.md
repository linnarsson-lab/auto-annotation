Schwann Cells

Justification:

[10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02745.x] Here, we analyze MbpSCE1 in vitro and in vivo and show that MbpSCE1 also activates another myelin gene, Mpz, specifically in Schwann cells in transgenic mice

Mpz - [http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MPZ] This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath

Prss56 - They do lineage tracing in [10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.06.005]. "These cells form the so-called boundary caps (BCs), which are transiently observed at the nerve root entry/exit points along the neural tube (Niederlander and Lumsden, 1996). Fate analyses, taking advantage of BC-specific expression of the Krox20 (also known as Egr2) transcription factor gene and available knockins at this locus (Vermeren et al., 2003; Voiculescu et al., 2000), have established that BC cells give rise to the Schwann cell component of the nerve roots and, in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), to nociceptive neurons as well as glial satellite cells (Maro et al., 2004)""

Be carefull with Astrocyte definition becouse they are also Aldoc and Aldh1a1 positive! Tnc is a good discriminator (at least in development)
