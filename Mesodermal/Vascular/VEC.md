Vascular endothelial cell

Justification:

* Expresses canonical vascular endothelial marker Cldn5

Cldn5 and Flt1  are lineage specific but also mark earlier vascular cells (e.g. angioblasts)
Notice the developmental version of this cell type is better caracterized by the following markers:
Slc38a5, Ly6A, Cd93, Sox18, Nostrin
