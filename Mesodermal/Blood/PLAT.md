Platelet or Megakaryocyte 
TODO: try to determine if platelet or its progenitor the megakaryocyte

Justification:

Itga2b (also called CD41) - is the typical platellet marker [https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-09-457929]
Here was not included among markers becouse it is also present in the vascolature (lower levels)

They have the complete Von Willebrand receptor composed by Gp9, Gp5, Gp1bb [https://books.google.se/books?id=F7Jn7U2YxxMC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=gp5+gp9+ppbp&source=bl&ots=jl2_3XHoHY&sig=Inaezcp8VQHpfI4cI8g3likq1A8&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=gp5%20gp9%20ppbp&f=false]

Notice they also share many markers with Leukocytes.... Could it be one/more platelet stuck on a Leukocyte? Or is this expected?
