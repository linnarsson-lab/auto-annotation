Rostral Telencephalic Patterning Centre

Justification:

NOTE: annotation transferred from mouse. It's doubtful if the commissural plate even exists as a molecular entity in human.

Takes the name of Anterior Neural Ridge (ANR) early when the neaural tube is open or Comissural Plate (CoP) later

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397265-1.00021-6] The initial, tangential gradients of transcription factors (TFs) in the ventricular zone (VZ) are established by signaling molecules/morphogens secreted from telencephalic patterning centers, such as Fgf8 and Fgf17 from the anterior neural ridge (ANR), which later becomes the commissural plate (CoP)

[doi:10.1002/cne.21709] At E10.5, Fgf8 and Fgf18 were expressed in similar domains in the commissural plate (Fig. 2A,D). By contrast, Fgf17 was expressed in a broader domain, particularly in the dorsal dimension
