TODO: what is the germ layer origin of these cells?

Justification:

* Expresses a known set of marker identified in [1]

[1] Marques et al. Science 2016

In the development a set a more decisive markers would be:
+Slc22a6 +Slc6a13 +Islr +Ptgds

Igf2 hardly is correct for a definition since it is expressed by other clusters. Col1a1 is also in other cell types
I removed them and added instead Slc6a13, Islr and Lum
